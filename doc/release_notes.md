# Reliance Edge Release Notes

This file contains a list of updates made to Reliance Edge over the course of
recent releases and a list of known issues.

## Release History and Changes

### Reliance Edge v0.9 (Beta), April 2015

First public release.

## Known Issues

### Visual Studio 2005

The Reliance Edge Win32 port (used for the host tools and the Win32 test
project) cannot be compiled by Visual Studio 2005.  This is not going to be
fixed since VS2005 is an old toolset.  Newer versions of Visual Studio, starting
with Visual Studio 2008, work just fine.
